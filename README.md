# Python Learning Codes

This repository contains my personal Python practice files created while learning the language.

### ðŸ“‚ What's inside:
- Basic syntax and print statements
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions 
- Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets
- File handling
- Jump statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)
- Practice programs and mini tasks

These files are part of my coding journey and are saved here for future reference.

ðŸ§  Still learning, and this repo will grow with me!
